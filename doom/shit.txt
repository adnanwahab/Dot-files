"I doubt you could even imagine it... that which commanded the stars, giving life its fullest brilliance. The Elden Ring - ohhh, Elden Ring! Shattered... by someone, or something. Don't tell me you can't see it. Look up at the sky. It burns!"
"I alone am enough."

"Your ass is grass, and I've got the weedwhacker!"


when someone says i want you to dominate me
it kinda means that sometime 1 million years ago, some people had an imusle to get horny when they were coerced.
and then these peopel had kids... more than people who had a "healthy" response to violence.
so basically, at our core, like near the "survival instinct" prat of the brain, you are nuts.
if coerced:
  get wet

Magneto is widely feared, especially by humans, due to his extraordinary power and his intellect and charismatic personality as well as his sheer ruthlessness in achieving his goals. Even other super villains are wary of getting on his bad side.



im no jobs fanboy, but you cannot deny his affect on the industry
for a decade or so, when apple was worth 2x microsoft
50% of sf had steve jobs syndrome

why was he able to bring apple back from bankruptcy to 2 trillion?

lsd strips off the "filters" and "biases" that we sometimes rely on in order to function
those biases are important in order for our brains to function normally in a state of nature
they save time and erngy , which are precious resources
but when something unprecedented happened, our biases stop us from seeing it

basically, i believe that the idea of simplicity, and focus, adn conviction all came lsd
i think it was also cause he was a bit of spiritualist

note that its kinda contradictory to be a zen spiritualist, but also cheat people out of their stocks
or to be an abbrasive asshole.

i think it was this tendency to be an abrasive asshole that got him fired.
it is possible that apple, and perhaps the world economy would be even more sucessful if he had
so its complicated

of course there are a confluence of factors that lead to being lucky, at the right place at the right time
right before the tsunami of the personal computing revolution
powered by moores law and economies of scale


There's no heroes or villains. There's just what I want and how I'll get it.
allacrity haste timestop
To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour
"Witness the power of time."
